	<h2>Definition of Psychology</h2>	
	<p>
Psyche + logos = soul + study  = study of soul</p>
Since soul cannot be measured /observed – this definition was wrong – so psychology lost its soul
Next Defn – Scientific study of mind – this was also rejected – so psychology lost its mind
Next Defn – Scientific study of consciousness – this was also wrong – so psychology lost its consciousness.
So we say that–“First Psychology lost its soul then its mind and then its consciousness”
Next Defn – scientific  study of behaviour
Zimbardo = “ Scientific study of behaviour and mental or cognitive processes”Behaviour= Overt Mental/Cognitive= Covert Why “scientific”? To study behaviour 
and mental processes in both animals and humans, researchers must observe them. Whenever a human being observes anyone or anything, there’s always a 
possibility that the observer will see only what he or she expects to see. Psychologists don’t want to let these possible biases* cause them to make
 faulty observations. They want to be precise, and to measure as carefully as they can—so they use the scientific method to study psychology.
Morgan & King –“It is the scientific study of human and animal behaviour and it includes the application of the science for solving human problems.
When we say behaviour, we are not excluding mind but all we are saying is that behaviour is the avenue through which internal mental events can be
 studied. Keeping this in view, psychology is defined formally as a science which studies mental processes, experiences and behaviour in different contexts.
When we say experiences are internal to the experiencing person, we refer to states of consciousness or awareness or mental processes. 
We use our mental processes when we think or try to solve a problem, to know or remember something. One level at which these mental 
processes are reflected is the brain activity
However, we cannot say that brain activities and mental processes are the same. Mental activities and neural activities are
 mutually overlapping processes but, they are not identical. Unlike the brain, the mind does not have a physical structure nor
 has a location. Mind emerges and evolves as our interactions and experiences in this world get dynamically organised in the form 
 of a system which is responsible for the occurrence of various mental processes.
Psychologists also study experiences of people. Experiences are subjective in nature. We cannot directly observe or know someone else’s experience.
Behaviours are responses or reactions we make or activities we engage in. Some behaviours are overt. They can be outwardly seen or sensed by an 
observer. Some are internal or covert. When you are in a difficult situation while playing a game of chess you almost feel your hand muscles 
twitching, trying to experiment with a move. All behaviours, covert or overt, are associated with or triggered by some stimulus
 in the environment or changes that happen internally. Both stimulus and response can be internal or external.
Psychology seeks to understand and explain how the mind works and how different mentalprocesses result in different behaviours.
 Thus, psychology as a discipline today has two parallel streams. One which makes use of the method in physical and biological
 sciences and the other which makes use of the method of social and cultural sciences in studying various psychological and social phenomena.
